Tropical coral reefs are home to a remarkable variety of living formations and structures. But there is also a huge amount of similarity on reefs, including species that are almost impossible to tell apart.

We call this similarity 'redundancy' because, like spare parts in a machine, similar species can reduce the chance of failure, or increase reliability.

One way to measure differences and similarities among species is to use 'functional traits' - important attributes of organisms such as their structure or physiology.

This study analysed the functional traits of corals in 12 tropical regions across the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic oceans. It found that more diverse systems have larger numbers of very unique species, generating a greater overall variety of traits.

Locations with more species also show greater similarity or redundancy. This means that under stress, there are fail-safes in the community that can potentially step up into similar roles to keep the community intact and functioning. Meanwhile, regions with lower species numbers are more vulnerable to failure.
