Millions of species live on coral reefs. Some are incredibly unique. Others are so similar to each other that they're almost impossible to tell apart. This study argues that similarity is a good thing, because it means that more species do the same job and can cover for the ones that disappear. But for corals, there are some places in the world where just a few weird and irreplaceable species are doing all the work. We suggest that these are the regions to worry about the most.
