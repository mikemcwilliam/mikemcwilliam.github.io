Millions of species live on coral reefs. Some are highly unique. Some are very similar to others. Similarity or “redundancy” is beneficial, because it provides fail-safe species that can support the ecosystem when others become depleted. Yet for corals, there are entire regions where just a few unique and irreplaceable species are doing all the work to support the ecosystem. We suggest that these regions are more vulnerable to collapse.
