The functioning of ecosystems depends on the species present, and on their abundances and interactions.

This study presents an analysis of how coral species richness and composition affects primary productivity, an important metric of coral reef function.

Using experimental manipulations and 3D modelling of coral communities, we find direct evidence for beneficial interactions between neighbouring corals of different species, and a positive effect of diversity.

Our results advance the study of ecosystem function by comparing the influence of (i) species richness, (ii) species traits, (iii) neighbour interactions, and (iv) environmental conditions, on the productivity of coral communities.

We find that each can have complex and interacting effects on ecosystem function. Simple traits are more predictive when one species is present. Neighbour interactions have greater importance in diverse communities.
