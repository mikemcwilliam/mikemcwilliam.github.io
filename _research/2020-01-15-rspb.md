After an ecological disturbance like a storm, a fire, or bleaching, the species that bounce back are often a subset of those present before. This study shows that while recovering reefs can look healthy and vibrant, key pieces of the puzzle are often missing, including important traits that help support the reef ecosystem. This is likely to get worse as disturbances like bleaching get more frequent with climate change.
