After a major ecological disaster like hurricanes or mass bleaching, the species that bounce back are usually a subset of those that were there before. For corals, we show that the recovering community is usually lacking in important traits, including traits that help support the reef ecosystem. Although recovering reefs can look healthy and vibrant, key pieces of the puzzle are often missing. This is likely to get worse as disturbances like bleaching get more frequent under climate change.
