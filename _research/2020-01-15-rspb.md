A single coral reef can be home to hundreds of coral species. During a disturbance different populations of species crash dramatically, and then either recover or remain depleted.

This study shows that when recovery is unobstructed, the populations that bounce back are a minor subset of the species that were present before the disturbance, generating a lower-diversity reef community.

"Functional traits" are individual characteristics that influence the wider ecosystem. The study shows that we’ve lost important traits over the last few decades, because the organisms that provide them haven’t recovered. The end result is a a community of corals that looks and acts differently to what it was before.

“Response diversity” is a process where if one species declines, another replaces it and maintains its role in the ecosystem. We saw some signs of response diversity in this study, but it was limited, and therefore important ecological roles were lost.

Although recovering reefs may look healthy and vibrant, key pieces of the puzzle are often missing. This is likely to get worse as disturbances like bleaching get more frequent and intense under climate change.
