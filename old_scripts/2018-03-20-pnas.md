Tropical coral reefs are home to a remarkable variety of living formations and structures. Among them are the reef-building corals, which show a striking range of shapes and sizes.  

They include towering columns, meandering valleys, bushy thickets, round boulders, and giant cabbage-like structures. They are corals you can fit in your hand, versus corals the size of a house. Some grow tall and form shady canopies that you can swim under. Others remain completely flat, and pave the ocean floor.

The importance of this variety for reef ecosystems has been recognised for decades. But on top of these differences, there is also a huge amount of similarity on reefs; species that are so similar they are almost impossible to tell apart. We call this similarity 'redundancy,' not because they are worthless, but because like a machine (e.g. a Boeing 747 with four engines when it only needs one), they can reduce the chance of failure, or increase reliability.

Measuring this variety - and similarity - can be complicated. One method is to use 'functional traits', which are important characteristics of organisms that influence the wider ecosystem. [**This paper**](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3084.short) examined 12 distinct regions across the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and analysed functional traits of corals to measure the diversity and redundancy of these traits.

Using global [**functional trait data**](https://research.jcu.edu.au/researchdata/default/detail/2d343a3dc21a6a25831f3fbaa508efa7/), we found that provinces with larger numbers of species have - counterintuitively - both a greater variety of traits, and also a greater similarity, or redundancy, among species. This means that when stress strikes, there are fail-safes within the community that can potentially step up into similar roles to keep the community intact and functioning.

The study also identifies locations across the world with limited numbers of functionally important species. Coral reefs in these regions are like Boeing 747s with just one working engine left, and their lack of redundancy can leave them more vulnerable to failure.

Importantly, functional redundancy is of little use if each redundant component fails at the same time. Such a scenario is becoming more likely as the stress put on reef systems by climate change increases. Regions with low redundancy are especially vulnerable to this, because the chance that any one species will show higher tolerance or faster regeneration than it's counterparts is lower.
