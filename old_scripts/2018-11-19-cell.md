The functioning of ecosystems depends on the species present, and on their abundances and interactions.

[**This paper**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221831220X) presents an analysis of how coral species richness and composition affects primary productivity, an important metric of coral reef ecosystem function.

We use experimental manipulations and 3D modelling of coral communities [**(data here)**](https://research.jcu.edu.au/researchdata/default/detail/d92d106258f6584fcfb880d79d5e6e10/) to test the effect of close neighbours on coral productivity, finding  direct evidence for beneficial interactions between corals of different species, and a positive effect of diversity.

Our results advance the study of ecosystem function by comparing the influence of (i) species richness, (ii) species traits, (iii) neighbour interactions, and (iv) environmental conditions, on the productivity of coral communities.

Even in a chamber, we find that each can have complex and interacting effects on ecosystem function:
 - simple traits (colony areas) have a stronger predictive effect when only one species is present
 - neighbours have a greater influence during specific environmental conditions (high flow).
 - the role of diversity is affected by everything: traits, environment, interactions

Knowledge of how ecosystem function is controlled is critical to predict how ecosystems will change in response to the loss of species, including how reefs will respond to a warming world. This paper suggests that this is a complex problem to solve, but diversity is key.
