A single coral reef can be home to hundreds of coral species. During a disturbance different populations of species crash dramatically, and then either recover or remain depleted.

[**This paper**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.2628) shows that when recovery is unobstructed, the populations that bounce back are a minor subset of the species that were present before the disturbance, generating a lower-diversity reef community.

“Functional traits” are important characteristics of organisms that influence the wider ecosystem. For corals these often include the branches that provide refuge for fish, or the bulky skeletons that build the reef.

By monitoring coral functional traits over the last few decades [**(data here)**](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.kh189321w), this paper shows that we’ve lost some of these traits because the organisms that provide them haven’t recovered. The end result is a a community of corals that looks and acts differently to what it was before.

“Response diversity” is a process where if one species declines, another replaces it and maintains its role in the ecosystem. We saw some signs of response diversity in this study, but it was very limited, and therefore important ecological roles were lost.

Many coral species are relatively small, fast-growing and short-lived, and these can recover quickly. Other species are slow-growing and live to be many decades or centuries old, and if these populations are lost, their capacity to recover is limited.

Although reefs that have recently recovered from disturbance may look healthy and vibrant, this paper shows that long-lived species are key pieces of the puzzle that are often missing or depleted.

Importantly, this work analysed reef disturbances that occurred before the major coral bleaching events that occurred globally in 2016-17. So the cycle of disturbance and recovery is now repeating itself again, and is likely to repeat itself over and over again in the future. We don’t know how corals are going to cope with this.
